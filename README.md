# DolphinsAI

## Project Overview
DolphinsAI is a machine learning project designed to facilitate the process of data analysis, model training, and prediction. The project includes a structured pipeline from data preprocessing to model inference, with the ability to containerize the entire application for easy deployment.

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular and organized structure:

```

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker (optional, for containerization)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DolphinsAI.git
   cd DolphinsAI
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python src/main.py
   ```

4. Run the tests:
   ```bash
   python -m unittest discover tests/
   ```

## Project Components

### Data Preprocessing
The `data/data_prep.py` script handles data loading and preprocessing. The raw data should be placed in the `data/raw/` directory, and processed data will be saved in `data/processed/` after running the script.

### Model Training
The training script in `src/models/train.py` trains a machine learning model on the processed data. The model is then saved to the `models/` directory.

### Model Prediction
Use `src/models/predict.py` to make predictions based on the trained model. The script loads the model from `models/trained_model.pkl` and outputs predictions.

### Utilities
The `src/utils/helper.py` file contains helper functions, such as model saving, that are used across the project.

## Using Docker
A `Dockerfile` is included to containerize the application.

To build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t dolphinsai .
```

To run the container:
```bash
docker run dolphinsai
```

## Jupyter Notebooks
The `notebooks/` directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis (EDA) and initial model experimentation. Use these notebooks to understand the dataset and experiment with different models before productionizing them.
